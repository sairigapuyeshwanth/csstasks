            <h2>Virat</h2>
            <div>India’s cricketing icon Virat Kohli made headlines when he embraced a vegetarian lifestyle a few years ago, a surprising shift for a player who once relished dishes like butter chicken. The cricketer, known for his commitment to fitness, elucidated how eliminating non-vegetarian fare contributed to his enhanced physical well-being. However, a recent Instagram story showcasing his enjoyment of ‘mock chicken tikka’ left some fans perplexed.

                Unveiling the backstory, Virat’s story featured an empty plate accompanied by the caption, “You’ve really nailed this mock chicken tikka.” For those unfamiliar, a mock chicken tikka is a vegetarian rendition, prepared in a manner similar to the traditional chicken version but using plant-based alternatives like jackfruit, soy protein, or tofu. Virat’s culinary choice reflects the expanding realm of vegetarian options, bridging the gap between taste preferences and dietary preferences in an increasingly diverse culinary landscape.</div>
